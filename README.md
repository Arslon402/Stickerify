## How to use the bot

You can use the bot going [here](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot): start it, and you can now send it the images you need to convert.

Based on what you send, [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot) will answer the following:

* the converted image, if you sent a supported file (currently `.gif`, `.gifv` and `.webp` files are not supported)
* an error message, if you sent an unsupported file
* an informative message for any message without a file

## How to create a new sticker

1. Chat with [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers), and use it to create a sticker pack
2. Ask [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers) to add a new sticker
3. Use [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot) to create the proper file for your sticker
4. Forward [Stickerify](https://t.me/StickerifyImageBot)'s message to [Stickers](https://t.me/Stickers)
5. Choose an emoji representing your sticker

And it's done!

## How to set up the project

1. Install Maven and JDK 19 (or higher)
2. Clone the project and move into its folder
3. Run the command `mvn install -DskipTests`
4. Import the project inside your IDE as a Maven project
5. Ensure your IDE is correctly configured to use a Java 19 (or higher) JDK

## How to run the bot locally

After you successfully set up the project, you will have to go through the following steps:

1. Chat with [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and ask it to create a new bot
2. Copy the token it provided you and either:
   * set it as the value of a new environment variable named `STICKERIFY_TOKEN` 
   * use it as the return value of the method `getBotToken()` inside `StickerifyBot`
3. Run the `Main` class to start the bot, it will be now able to answer messages in Telegram

## Launch the bot using Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Run Docker, passing it the argument variable with the following command:
   ```shell
   docker build -t build-name --build-arg name=arg-name 
   ```
3. In our case, the specific command will be:
   ```shell
   docker build -t stickerify --build-arg STICKERIFY_TOKEN={{TOKEN}} 
   docker run stickerify
   ```
   where `{{TOKEN}}` is the token which will be retrieved from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
